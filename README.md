The Unresolved Obstacles Source Term (UOST, Mentaschi et al. 2018, 2015, 2019) is a general methodology to parameterize the dissipative effects of 
subscale islands, cliffs and unresolved coastal features in ocean wave models. 
It can be applied to any numerical scheme and modulates the dissipation with spectral direction. 
Its applicability to practical contexts is now made possible by the development of the software package **alphaBetaLab**,
which given a mesh and a high-resolution bathymetry is able to automatically estimate the cell-dependent 
transparency coefficients needed by UOST.
